A simple program to develop several recursive functions.

**Problem:**

Develop three functions that must satisfy the Big-O requirements as shown below

1. Develop a function that uses a loop to calculate x<sup>n</sup> in O(n)
2. Develop a function that recursively calculates x<sup>n</sup> in O(n)
3. Develop a function that recursively calculates x<sup>n</sup> in O(log n)
4. Develop a function that has O(2<sup>n</sup>) time complexity.
